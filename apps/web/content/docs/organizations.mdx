# Organizations

Organizations are the foundation of SQLBase's multi-tenant architecture. They provide isolated workspaces where teams can collaborate on database projects with role-based permissions and secure access control.

<Callout type="info">
**Key Concept**: Every project, database connection, and team member belongs to an organization. This ensures data isolation and proper access control.
</Callout>

## Overview

An organization in SQLBase is a workspace that contains:

- **Projects**: Database projects with connections and configurations
- **Members**: Team members with specific roles and permissions  
- **Invitations**: Pending email invitations for new team members
- **Usage Metrics**: Storage, compute, and resource tracking
- **Settings**: Organization-wide configurations and preferences

## Organization Roles

SQLBase implements a three-tier role system:

### Owner
- **Full administrative control** over the organization
- Can manage all members, projects, and settings
- Can delete the organization
- **Cannot be removed** by other members
- **One per organization** (the creator)

### Admin
- Can **manage members** and their roles
- Can **create and delete** projects
- Can **send invitations** to new team members
- Can access **all organization projects**
- Cannot delete the organization

### Member
- Can **view and edit** assigned projects
- Can **execute SQL queries** within permitted projects
- **Cannot manage** other team members
- **Cannot create** new projects (admin approval required)

## Creating an Organization

When you first sign up for SQLBase, you'll see an onboarding screen prompting you to create your first organization.

### Manual Creation

You can create additional organizations anytime:

1. **Navigate to Dashboard**: Click the organization selector in the top-left
2. **Select "Create Organization"**: From the dropdown menu
3. **Fill Organization Details**:
   - **Name**: Display name (e.g., "Acme Corp")
   - **Slug**: URL-friendly identifier (e.g., "acme-corp")
   - **Description**: Optional description of your organization

```typescript title="Organization Creation Example"
// The organization creation dialog automatically generates
// a slug from the name, but you can customize it
const organizationData = {
  name: "Acme Corporation",
  slug: "acme-corp", // Used in URLs
  description: "Our main development organization"
}
```

<Callout type="warn">
**Organization Slug**: The slug is used in URLs and must be unique across SQLBase. Choose carefully as it affects your project URLs.
</Callout>

## Organization Dashboard

The organization dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your workspace:

### Usage Metrics

- **Team Access**: Number of members with access

## Managing Members

### Viewing Members

The members dialog shows all organization participants:

```typescript title="Member Information Structure"
interface OrganizationMember {
  id: string
  organization_id: string
  user_id: string
  email: string
  role: 'owner' | 'admin' | 'member'
  status: 'active' | 'pending' | 'suspended'
  joined_at: string
  invited_at: string
  invited_by: string
  user?: {
    id: string
    name: string
    email: string
    image?: string
  }
}
```

### Member Operations

**Role Changes** (Admin/Owner only):
- Change member from "Member" to "Admin" or vice versa
- Role changes take effect immediately
- Members are notified of role changes

**Removing Members** (Admin/Owner only):
- Remove members from the organization
- All member access to projects is revoked
- Member data is preserved for audit trail

### Pending Invitations

Track and manage email invitations:

- **View Status**: See which invitations are pending, accepted, or expired
- **Resend Invitations**: Send reminder emails for pending invitations
- **Cancel Invitations**: Revoke pending invitations before acceptance
- **Expiration Management**: Invitations expire after 7 days

## Organization Settings

### Basic Information

Update organization details:
- **Display Name**: Shown in navigation and project lists
- **Description**: Optional description for team context
- **Logo**: Upload organization logo (optional)

### Advanced Settings

**URL Slug**:
- Used in project URLs: `/dashboard/organizations/{slug}/projects/{id}`
- Cannot be changed after creation (contact support if needed)

**Member Permissions**:
- Default role for new invitations
- Project creation permissions
- API access controls

### Billing and Usage

**Plan Management**:
- View current subscription tier
- Usage limits and overages
- Billing history and invoices

**Resource Limits**:
- Storage quotas per tier
- Compute hour allocations
- Member count restrictions

## Switching Organizations

Users can belong to multiple organizations and switch between them:

### Organization Selector

1. **Click Organization Name**: In the top navigation
2. **Select Target Organization**: From the dropdown
3. **Context Switch**: All views update to the selected organization

```typescript title="Organization Context Switching"
// SQLBase automatically saves your last selected organization
// and restores it on next login
localStorage.setItem(`current-org-${userId}`, organizationId)
```

### Cross-Organization Access

**Isolated Data**: Each organization's data is completely isolated
**Separate Permissions**: Roles and access are per-organization
**Independent Billing**: Each organization has its own subscription

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Your First Organization

When you sign up for SQLBase, you'll see a beautiful onboarding screen that guides you through creating your first organization:

1. **Welcome Screen**: You'll see feature highlights and a prominent "Create Your First Organization" button
2. **Organization Form**: Fill in your organization name (e.g., "Acme Corp") and the system auto-generates a URL-friendly slug
3. **Add Description**: Optionally describe your organization's purpose
4. **Create**: Click "Create Organization" and you're ready to go!

### Adding Your First Team Member

Once your organization is created:

1. **Click "Invite"**: From your organization dashboard
2. **Enter Email**: Add your teammate's email address
3. **Choose Role**: Select Admin (can manage team) or Member (can use projects)
4. **Personal Message**: Add a welcome message (optional)
5. **Send Invitation**: Your teammate receives a professional email invitation

### Managing Your Team

The "Members" button shows your entire team:

- **Active Members**: See who's already in your organization with their roles
- **Pending Invitations**: Track who you've invited but hasn't joined yet
- **Quick Actions**: Resend invitations or change member roles with a few clicks

## Best Practices

### Organization Structure

**Single Purpose**: Create organizations for specific teams or projects
**Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names that indicate the organization purpose
**Consistent Roles**: Establish clear role definitions across organizations

### Member Management

**Regular Audits**: Review member lists quarterly
**Role Minimization**: Grant minimum required permissions
**Offboarding Process**: Remove departing team members promptly

### Project Organization

**Logical Grouping**: Group related databases within the same organization
**Environment Separation**: Consider separate organizations for prod/staging
**Access Control**: Use projects to control database-level access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Cannot Create Organization**:
```
Error: Organization slug already exists
```
- Choose a different, unique slug
- Slugs must be globally unique across SQLBase

**Member Invitation Failed**:
```
Error: Invalid email address
```
- Verify email format is correct
- Check for typos in email address
- Ensure recipient can receive external emails

**Role Change Denied**:
```
Error: Insufficient permissions
```
- Only Owners and Admins can change roles
- Cannot change your own role
- Cannot remove the organization Owner

### Getting Help

If you encounter organization-related issues:

1. **Check Permissions**: Verify you have the required role
2. **Review Limits**: Ensure you haven't exceeded plan limits
3. **Contact Support**: For slug changes or complex issues
