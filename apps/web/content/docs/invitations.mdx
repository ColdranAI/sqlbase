### Email Delivery Issues

**Corporate Email Filters**:

2. Use alternative email addresses
3. Contact support for delivery assistance

### Resolution Steps

If invitations aren't working:

1. **Verify Email**: Double-check email address accuracy
2. **Check Filters**: Review spam and corporate email filters
3. **Resend**: Generate new invitation with fresh token
4. **Alternative Email**: Try different email address
