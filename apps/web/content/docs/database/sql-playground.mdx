# SQL Playground

The SQL Playground is where you interact with your database through an intuitive interface. Write queries, explore your data, and analyze results - all in a beautifully designed environment that makes SQL approachable for everyone.

<Callout type="info">
**Smart Query Interface**: The playground includes syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and query formatting to help you write better SQL.
</Callout>

## Getting Started

Once your database is connected, the SQL Playground becomes your primary workspace for data exploration and analysis.

### Interface Overview

The playground is divided into three main areas:

1. **Query Editor** (Left): Where you write your SQL queries
2. **Schema Browser** (Right): Explore your database structure
3. **Results Panel** (Bottom): View query results and execution details

## Writing Your First Query

### Quick Start Tutorial

Let's walk through executing your first query:

1. **Open the Playground**
   - Navigate to your project
   - Click the "SQL Playground" tab
   - You'll see the query editor ready for input

2. **Explore Your Schema**
   - Look at the right sidebar showing your tables
   - Click on any table to see its columns
   - Use this to understand your data structure

3. **Write a Simple Query**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. **Execute the Query**
   - Click the "Execute Query" button (or press Ctrl+Enter)
   - Results appear in the bottom panel
   - Execution time and row count are displayed

### Query Editor Features

**Syntax Highlighting**
- SQL keywords are highlighted in blue
- Strings appear in green
- Comments are shown in gray
- Table and column names are color-coded

**Auto-Completion**
- Type table names and see suggestions
- Column names auto-complete when you reference tables
- SQL keywords complete as you type
- Press Tab to accept suggestions

**Query Formatting**
- Right-click and select "Format Query" to clean up your SQL
- Proper indentation and spacing applied automatically
- Makes complex queries easier to read

## Schema Browser

The right sidebar is your database navigation tool:

### Table Explorer
- **Tables List**: All your tables with row counts
- **Expand Tables**: Click to see columns and types
- **Search**: Find specific tables quickly
- **Sorting**: Tables ordered by size by default

### Column Information
For each table, you can see:
- **Column Name**: The field identifier
- **Data Type**: PostgreSQL type (TEXT, INTEGER, TIMESTAMP, etc.)
- **Constraints**: Primary keys, foreign keys, NOT NULL
- **Sample Values**: Preview actual data (when available)

### Quick Actions
- **Click Column**: Adds it to your query at cursor position
- **Click Table**: Adds table name to query
- **Double-Click**: Adds fully qualified name (schema.table.column)

## Query Execution

### Running Queries

**Execute Button**
- Click "Execute Query" to run your SQL
- Button shows loading spinner during execution
- Turns green when query completes successfully

**Keyboard Shortcuts**
- `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Enter` (Mac): Execute query
- `Ctrl+/` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+/` (Mac): Comment/uncomment lines
- `Ctrl+A` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+A` (Mac): Select all

**Multiple Queries**
- Separate multiple queries with semicolons
- Only the query where your cursor is located will execute
- Select text to run only specific portions

### Query Results

**Results Table**
- Clean, sortable table showing your data
- Click column headers to sort
- Scroll horizontally for wide result sets
- Copy individual cells or entire rows

**Execution Details**
- **Execution Time**: How long the query took
- **Rows Returned**: Number of result rows
- **Columns**: Number of columns in result set
- **Query Status**: Success, error, or warning indicators

**Export Options**
- **Copy**: Copy results to clipboard
- **JSON**: Export as JSON format
- **CSV**: Download as comma-separated values

## Common Query Patterns

### Data Exploration

**See Table Structure**
```sql
-- View first few rows to understand data
SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 5;

-- Count total records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;

-- See column types and constraints
\d customers
```

**Find Specific Data**
```sql
-- Search for specific customers
SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com';

-- Find recent orders
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

### Data Analysis

**Aggregation Queries**
```sql
-- Sales by month
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as month,
  COUNT(*) as orders,
  SUM(total) as revenue
FROM orders 
GROUP BY month 
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

**Joining Tables**
```sql
-- Customer orders with details
SELECT 
  c.name,
  c.email,
  o.total,
  o.created_at
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.created_at > '2024-01-01';
```

## Query Management

### Query History

SQLBase automatically saves your query history:

- **Recent Queries**: Access your last 50 queries
- **Search History**: Find queries by keywords
- **Rerun Queries**: Click any historical query to rerun it
- **Save Favorites**: Star important queries for quick access

### Organizing Queries

**Query Comments**
```sql
-- Customer Analysis: Find high-value customers
-- Created: 2024-01-15
-- Purpose: Monthly reporting
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total) as lifetime_value
FROM orders 
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(total) > 1000;
```

**Query Naming**
- Use descriptive comments at the top of queries
- Include purpose and creation date
- Note any specific business logic

## Performance Tips

### Writing Efficient Queries

**Use LIMIT for Exploration**
```sql
-- Good: Limit results when exploring
SELECT * FROM large_table LIMIT 100;

-- Avoid: Running queries that return millions of rows
SELECT * FROM large_table;
```

**Index-Friendly Queries**
```sql
-- Good: Use indexed columns in WHERE clauses
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123;

-- Less efficient: Functions on indexed columns
SELECT * FROM users WHERE UPPER(name) = 'JOHN';
```

**Specific Column Selection**
```sql
-- Good: Select only needed columns
SELECT name, email FROM users;

-- Less efficient: Select all columns when not needed
SELECT * FROM users;
```

### Understanding Query Plans

**EXPLAIN Your Queries**
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE customer_id = 123;
```

This shows:
- **Execution Plan**: How PostgreSQL runs your query
- **Cost Estimates**: Relative performance costs
- **Actual Time**: Real execution time
- **Rows Processed**: Number of rows examined

## Error Handling

### Common SQL Errors

**Syntax Errors**
```sql
-- Error: Missing FROM clause
SELECT name email FROM users;

-- Fixed: Proper syntax
SELECT name, email FROM users;
```

**Table/Column Not Found**
```sql
-- Error: Table name misspelled
SELECT * FROM costumers;

-- Fixed: Correct table name
SELECT * FROM customers;
```

**Permission Errors**
```sql
-- Error: No permission to access table
SELECT * FROM sensitive_data;

-- Solution: Contact your database administrator
```

### Error Messages

SQLBase provides helpful error messages:

- **Line Numbers**: Shows exactly where the error occurred
- **Suggestions**: Offers potential fixes
- **Context**: Highlights the problematic SQL section
- **Documentation Links**: Links to relevant PostgreSQL docs

## Advanced Features

- Use comments to document business rules
- Help teammates understand your analysis

### Data Visualization

**Result Formatting**
- Numeric columns show with proper formatting
- Dates display in readable format
- Boolean values show as Yes/No
- NULL values are clearly marked

**Quick Insights**
- Row counts for each query
- Column statistics when available

## Best Practices

### Query Organization

**Structure Your SQL**
```sql
-- Good: Well-formatted, readable query
SELECT 
  c.name,
  c.email,
  COUNT(o.id) as order_count,
  SUM(o.total) as total_spent
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.created_at > '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.email
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```

**Use Comments Effectively**
```sql
-- Monthly Revenue Report
-- Includes all customers who made purchases
-- Excludes refunded orders
SELECT 
  -- Customer information
  c.name,
  c.email,
  
  -- Order metrics
  COUNT(o.id) as orders,
  SUM(o.total) as revenue
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.status != 'refunded'  -- Exclude refunds
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.email;
```

### Security Considerations

**Safe Query Practices**
- Use `LIMIT` when exploring large tables
- Be cautious with `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements
- Test queries on small datasets first
- Always review queries before execution

**Data Privacy**
- Be mindful of sensitive data in query results
- Don't include passwords or personal data in shared queries
- Follow your organization's data handling policies
