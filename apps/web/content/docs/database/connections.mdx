# Connecting Your Database

SQLBase makes it easy to connect your PostgreSQL database securely. Whether your database is in the cloud, behind a firewall, or on your local network, we've got you covered with multiple connection methods.

<Callout type="info">
**Security First**: All database credentials are encrypted with AES-256-GCM encryption before being stored. Your data stays secure.
</Callout>

## Connection Methods

SQLBase offers three ways to connect your database, each designed for different scenarios:

<Tabs items={["Database URL", "SSH Tunnel", "WireGuard VPN"]}>

<Tab value="Database URL">
**Direct Connection** - The easiest method

Perfect for cloud databases and services that provide direct connection strings.

**When to use**:
- Cloud providers (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database)
- Managed services (Neon, Supabase, PlanetScale, Railway)
- Docker containers with exposed ports
- Development databases

**How it works**:
1. Get your connection string from your database provider
2. Paste it into SQLBase
3. Click "Test Connection" to verify
4. Save your configuration

**Example connection strings**:
```
postgresql://user:password@hostname:5432/database
postgres://user:password@hostname.region.provider.com:5432/db
```
</Tab>

<Tab value="SSH Tunnel">
**SSH Tunneling** - For secure environments

Connect through an SSH gateway server to reach databases behind firewalls.

**When to use**:
- Databases behind corporate firewalls
- On-premise servers accessible via SSH
- Additional security layer for cloud databases
- Bastion host configurations

**What you need**:
- SSH server hostname and port
- SSH username and private key
- Database connection details (accessible from SSH server)

**How it works**:
1. SQLBase connects to your SSH server
2. Creates a secure tunnel to your database
3. All traffic is encrypted end-to-end
4. Your database stays hidden from the internet
</Tab>

<Tab value="WireGuard VPN">
**VPN Connection** - For corporate networks

Connect through your existing WireGuard VPN infrastructure.

**When to use**:
- Corporate networks requiring VPN access
- Multi-cloud environments
- Compliance requirements for network isolation
- Remote access to internal databases

**What you need**:
- WireGuard configuration file from your IT team
- Database connection string (accessible via VPN)

**How it works**:
1. SQLBase establishes VPN connection using your config
2. Connects to database through secure tunnel
3. All traffic routed through your corporate network
4. Maintains audit trails and compliance
</Tab>

## Step-by-Step Connection Guide

### Method 1: Database URL (Recommended for beginners)

This is the most straightforward method for most cloud databases:

1. **Get Your Connection String**
   - Log into your database provider (Neon, Supabase, AWS, etc.)
   - Find the "Connection" or "Settings" section
   - Copy the PostgreSQL connection string

2. **Open SQLBase Project**
   - Navigate to your project
   - Click the "Database Connection" tab
   - Select "Database URL" at the top

3. **Enter Connection Details**
   - Paste your connection string in the text field
   - The format should look like: `postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db`

4. **Test the Connection**
   - Click "Test Connection" to verify everything works
   - You'll see a green checkmark if successful
   - Any errors will be displayed with helpful suggestions

5. **Save Configuration**
   - Click "Save Configuration" once the test passes
   - Your credentials are encrypted and stored securely
   - You'll automatically switch to the Database Overview tab

### Method 2: SSH Tunnel (For secure environments)

For databases accessible through SSH servers:

1. **Gather SSH Information**
   - SSH server hostname (e.g., `server.company.com`)
   - SSH port (usually 22)
   - Your SSH username
   - Path to your private key file

2. **Get Database Details**
   - Database hostname as seen from the SSH server
   - Database port (usually 5432)
   - Database name, username, and password

3. **Configure in SQLBase**
   - Select "SSH" tab in the connection dialog
   - Fill in SSH server details
   - Add your database connection string
   - Upload or paste your SSH private key

4. **Test and Save**
   - Click "Test Connection" to verify both SSH and database access
   - Save once successful

### Method 3: WireGuard VPN (For corporate networks)

For VPN-protected databases:

1. **Get WireGuard Config**
   - Request configuration from your IT team
   - Should include interface and peer settings
   - Usually provided as a `.conf` file

2. **Configure in SQLBase**
   - Select "WireGuard Config" tab
   - Paste your WireGuard configuration
   - Add your internal database connection string

3. **Test and Save**
   - SQLBase will establish VPN connection first
   - Then test database connectivity
   - Save once both connections work

## Connection Testing

SQLBase tests your connection before saving to ensure everything works correctly:

### What We Test
- **Network Connectivity**: Can we reach your database server?
- **Authentication**: Are your credentials correct?
- **Database Access**: Can we query basic information?
- **SSL/TLS**: Is the connection properly encrypted?

### Common Test Results

**✅ Connection Successful**
- Green checkmark indicates everything works
- You can proceed to save your configuration

**❌ Connection Timeout**
- Network connectivity issues
- Check hostname and port
- Verify firewall settings

**❌ Authentication Failed**
- Incorrect username or password
- Verify credentials with your database provider

**❌ Database Not Found**
- Database name is incorrect
- Check if database exists

## Security Features

### Encryption at Rest
All database credentials are encrypted using AES-256-GCM before storage. Even SQLBase administrators cannot view your actual credentials.

### Connection Security
- **SSL/TLS**: All database connections use encrypted transport
- **Certificate Validation**: SSL certificates are verified for authenticity
- **Secure Tunneling**: SSH and VPN connections provide additional encryption layers

### Access Control
- **Organization Isolation**: Database connections are scoped to your organization
- **Role-Based Access**: Only authorized team members can access configurations
- **Audit Logging**: All connection attempts and changes are logged

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Connection Timed Out"

**Possible Causes**:
- Database server is down or unreachable
- Firewall blocking connections
- Incorrect hostname or port

**Solutions**:
1. Verify your database is running
2. Check firewall rules and security groups
3. Test connection from your local machine first
4. Contact your database administrator

### "Authentication Failed"

**Possible Causes**:
- Wrong username or password
- User doesn't have required permissions
- Password has special characters

**Solutions**:
1. Verify credentials are correct
2. Ensure user has `CONNECT` permission on database
3. Try connecting with a database client first
4. Check if password needs URL encoding

### "SSL Connection Required"

**Possible Causes**:
- Database requires SSL connections
- SSL certificate issues

**Solutions**:
1. Enable SSL in your connection string
2. Add `?sslmode=require` to your connection URL
3. Contact your database provider for SSL requirements

### "Database Does Not Exist"

**Possible Causes**:
- Typo in database name
- Database hasn't been created yet
- User doesn't have access to database

**Solutions**:
1. Double-check database name spelling
2. Verify database exists in your provider's dashboard
3. Ensure your user has access permissions

## Best Practices

### Security
- **Use SSL**: Always enable SSL/TLS for database connections
- **Least Privilege**: Create dedicated database users for SQLBase with minimal required permissions
- **Regular Rotation**: Rotate database passwords periodically
- **Monitor Access**: Review database logs for suspicious activity

### Performance
- **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pooling if your database supports it
- **Nearby Regions**: Choose database regions close to SQLBase for better performance
- **Timeout Settings**: Configure appropriate timeout values for your network

### Organization
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear project names that indicate the database purpose
- **Environment Separation**: Use different projects for production and development databases
- **Team Access**: Only grant access to team members who need it
