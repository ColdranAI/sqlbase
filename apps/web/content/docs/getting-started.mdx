```
</Tab>

<Tab value="SSH Tunnel">
**SSH Tunneling** - For secure environments

</Step>

<Step>

## Explore Your Database

Once connected, you'll automatically see the **Database Overview** tab with:

### Quick Statistics

<Callout type="tip">
**First Time?** Click on a few tables to explore their structure. This helps you understand your data before writing queries.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

ORDER BY row_count_estimate DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
